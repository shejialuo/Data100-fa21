# Data100-fa21

This is my code for studying [Data100-fa21](https://ds100.org/fa21/). The
reason for choosing this semester is that we call watch the video. This is important.

## Environment Setup

In this course, you need to set up the environment for projects and labs. In ArchLinux,
it is easy.

```sh
sudo pacman -S jupyter-notebook
pip3 install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
pip3 install otter-grader==v2.2.7
```
